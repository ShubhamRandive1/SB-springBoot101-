Transaction in SQL =
" We can describe it as the number of operations performed together
 to alter the values or modify the values"

we can make the modifications and then do the successfull transaction and make the commit

and if transaction fails the transaction does not gives results

or again modify and rollback as well


we can do that by commit and rollback commands
